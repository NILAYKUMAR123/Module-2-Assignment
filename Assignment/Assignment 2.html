The interplay between composition and processing in producing snacks with a satisfactory sensory profile was addressed by e-sensing, and by molecular and rheological approaches. Soybean proteins play a main role in defining the properties of the protein network in the products. At the same content in soybean flour, use of parboiled rice flour increases the snack’s hardness. Electronic nose and electronic tongue discriminated samples containing a higher amount of soybean flour from those with a lower soybean flour content.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12" id="container"><p>atural starters have been extensively used for many centuries to make many different fermented food products from different raw materials: Milk,  meat, roots, vegetables, etc. The industrialisa- tion of food production at the end of the 19th century necessitated the use of regular selected starters to standardize the organoleptic characteristics of the final product. As  a  consequence, during the 20th century, there was a decline in the use of natural starters in Western countries ex- cept in the production of local cheeses or sourdough breads. The beginning of this new millennium has witnessed  a deep change in consumer demand, in pursuit of quality, safety and pleasure. In this context, natural starters could, in the future, play an important role in the development of fermented products. However, food producers and researchers have first to cope with fundamen- tal problems in the understanding of these complex ecosystems. The dynamic evolution of the mi- crobial population inside the natural starter (its resilience, its genetic and physiological aptitudes) and the consequences on the product are still partially unknown. This document reviews  a broad range of articles concerning the use of natural starters with a specific focus on cheeses and breads, and discusses the major stakes for local food production and the consumption of typical products. </p>

  Indian Sweets, locally known as ‘Mithai’, are a form of confectionery, usually made with milk, ghee, cottage cheese, sugar and other ingredients. The use of ingredients differs from one region to the other. Indian sweets are plentiful in number and nature and are most delicious dessert item. In fact, Indian cuisine is known throughout the world as a sweet cuisine because almost half of its dishes are either sweets or desserts. Many popular Indian sweets are common throughout South Asia, while others are specific to a certain region and are typical to only an ethnic group in India.

Sweets are also significant in Indian culture. Sweets are generally presented during festive occasions and ceremonies and also signify good omen, happiness and prosperity. In India every happy occasion is marked with the distribution of sweets.</p>
